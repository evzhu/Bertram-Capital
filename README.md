# Bertram-Capital Coding Challenge
After downloading CoffeeScheduler.java, compiling and running the file will bring up the terminal. It will query you for the specifics of each
coworker, which you give in the comma-separated format "name, drink preference, price".
Inputting the info for all 7 coworker will then allow you to query which coworker pays on a certain day (starts at 1). This is determined by 
calculating the coworker who has paid the lowest total amount thus far, which is then printed. This takes into account the different drink prices.
Thanks for your consideration!
